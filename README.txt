A minimalist Sudoku app, developed for and by me.

I've been developing this in my free time to learn about Android developement, Sudoku algorithms and for fun!
There are still minor bugs and UI problems, but nothing that should prevent the app from working. I'll probably continue updating my code
for a little while, but don't expect any new features any time soon.

You can take parts of my code for your own stuff all you want, just mention me if you do, it would be appreciated.

This app is on Google Play at :
